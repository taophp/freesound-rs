# Freesound API Configuration - Sample Environment File
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a template for setting up your .env file for running tests with the freesound-rs library.
# NOTE: This file is only needed for running tests. Normal library usage requires explicitly
# providing your API key when creating a FreesoundClient instance.
#
# To use:
# 1. Copy this file to ".env" in your project root
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials
# 3. The .env file should not be committed to version control
#
# To obtain a Freesound API key:
# 1. Register for an account at https://freesound.org/
# 2. Visit https://freesound.org/apiv2/apply/ to create an API application
# 3. After approval, you'll receive your API key

# Your Freesound API key (required for tests)
